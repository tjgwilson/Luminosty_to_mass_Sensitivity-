MASS ORBITAL RADIUS SENSITIVITY CONVERTER (MORSC)

VERSION: 2.2

**************GETTING STARTED**************

Script requires following files to run:
1. File with list of: names of stars(only numerals), age (best, oldest, youngest), distance and magnitude
2. Files with Contrast/Seperation data from VIP for each star on list of stars in CURRENT DIRECTORY
3. File with Baraffe data contained in 3 column format: age, mass luminosity

**************SETUP**************
In script section 'DEFINED VARIABLES' change:

INPUT_NAMES = '<USER PATH>'
to the path of the file containing the list of star names (file 1.)

change:
INPUT_BARAFFE_DATA = '<USER PATH>'
to the path of the file containing the baraffe data (file 3.)
if file is in current directory just include file name.

separation_column = <integer>
to the column No. (starting at zero) of the contrast data containing the angular separation
contrast_column = <integer>
to the column No. of the contrast data containing the contrast.

SAVEFIG = <USER INPUT> set to 'True' to save plots of mass/orbital separation or ‘False’ to show figures during programming runtime (not recommended apart for debug)

SHOW_SURFACE = <USER INPUT> set to 'True' if a 3d plot of the baraffe data is required. Note, needs mpl_toolkits to be available



**************RUNNING**************

Open Terminal and navigate to folder containing the script.
to run type

/User/<file_name>$ /opt/local/bin/python2.7 mass_sensitivity.py


**************EXAMPLEs**************
See folder containing example inputs and outputs

**************TROUBLESHOOTING**************
File name folder must contain more than one row of stars (if only one star is require
copy and paste first line and change star name to one not in file so that the program runs)

Interpolation of the mass/magnitude line is set to kind='linear' as more accurate routines such as 'cubic' cause problems with when used on linux machines.
